## Iterative Design

Tips for people who want to design games -

> The most important thing you can do is to get into an iteration cycle where you can measure the impact of your work,
> have a hypothesis about how making changes will affect those variables, and ship changes regularly.
> It doesn't even matter that much what the content is -
> it's the iteration of hypothesis, changes, and measurement that will make you better at a faster rate than anything else we have seen.

Breath of the Wild is a recent title from Nintendo that adds open-world elements to the long-running Zelda series.



## In The Software World

The Waterfall Model is a Project Management framework.
Most of the time, in this major, when you hear people talk about this, it’s as a software development methodology.
The idea is that it’s a waterfall that takes you from the start of the project to the end.

Bonus question: What is "Verification" for us as game designers? Playtesting!

The problem with the waterfall model is (intentionally) in the name.
While a waterfall is great for going down, it is very difficult to go the other way on a waterfall.
What happens if when you’re in Verification, you realize that you didn’t quite get one of the requirements right.
You go all the way back up, and have to make changes all the way along here.


An iterative model means taking those steps of the waterfall, making them smaller, and doing them on repeat - in a loop.
People have done a lot of work on this from the software engineering standpoint.
Later in the quarter we are going to talk about some of these software engineering methodologies in a little bit more detail.
We’ll want to know about them not only because we are working on software projects in this class and want to apply them to our software development,
But also because there is a lot in common between the iterative design process in general and the “Playcentric Design Process” from our book (and similar iterative approaches you will find in other game design textbooks).

The most important thing I want you all to think about now is that you shouldn’t try to design your entire game first, and then travel down the waterfall.
Think in terms of trying to take small components of your game and go down a mini waterfall.
Try things out, prototype them, and test them.
