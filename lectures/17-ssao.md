Resources:

* [Learn OpenGL: SSAO](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/SSAO) -
  A good place to start!
* [John Chapman: SSAO Tutorianl](http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.nl/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html) -
  This is the basis for the Learn OpenGL tutorial, it is a little more advanced but describes the same technique with perhaps
  a little bit more technical accuracy.
* [SSAO With Depth Reconstruction](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial46/tutorial46.html) -
  How to reconstruct view space values from depth buffer. I haven't used this exact technique yet, but I have a more expensive approach
  that works as well.
* [ionEngine SSAO Sample](https://github.com/iondune/ionEngineSamples/tree/master/SSAO) -
  My sample code.
* [Comparative Study of SSAO Techniques](http://frederikaalund.com/a-comparative-study-of-screen-space-ambient-occlusion-methods/) -
  Advanced but a good look at the different approaches used.
