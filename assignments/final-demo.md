### Project Demonstration

Each team will have 10-15 minutes to present their final project to the class during the final exam period.
In addition, we will have some in class playability testing, where each team should have a playable version of their game set-up for class mates to try and assess
(this will happen at the 90% demo and it is expected that for 100% your team will have addressed major issues that arise in the game play assessment).


### Project Report

This is in the form of a web page and should contain the following information.
Also note that links should be relative (not absolute paths), and that you should submit the html and all necessary image and animation files in the same directory.

- Brief description of your project
- **All team members names**
- A mini user's guide,
- Sample output i.e. images
- **_A short animation clip of your game is required_**
- A list of all references used (e.g. tutorials, research papers, etc.)
- A list of what the team implemented for each required technology
  - A project executable

Project Report submission (through GitHub Classroom) information will be provided later.
